# Prompt 05 — Review Test Coverage

## Purpose

Critically review existing QA artifacts to identify coverage gaps, weak areas, missing scenarios, redundant tests, unclear requirements, test case quality issues, checklist quality issues, and risks.

Use this prompt as a QA quality gate before test execution or automation planning begins.

## When to Use

- After test cases are written (`03-generate-test-cases.md`)
- After checklist is created (`02-generate-checklist.md`)
- After traceability matrix is created (`04-create-traceability-matrix.md`), if available
- Before starting a test execution cycle
- As a quality gate before automation candidate selection (`06-select-automation-candidates.md`)
- After major feature changes to check whether existing tests are still valid

## Input Required

**Mandatory:**
- Test cases from `qa/test-cases/[feature-name]-test-cases.md`
- Checklist from `qa/checklists/[feature-name]-checklist.md`

**Optional, but strongly recommended:**
- Traceability matrix from `qa/traceability/[feature-name]-rtm.md`
- QA analysis from `qa/analysis/[feature-name]-analysis.md`
- SRS / functional requirements from `docs/srs/` or `docs/requirements/`
- Acceptance criteria
- Design screenshots or design descriptions from `docs/designs/`
- API documentation from `docs/api/`
- Business rules from `docs/business-rules/`
- Known issues / previous QA comments
- Open questions from `qa/questions/`

## Prompt

```text
## Role

You are a Senior QA Engineer and QA Reviewer.

Your task is to critically review the provided QA artifacts and identify coverage gaps, weak areas, unclear requirements, redundant tests, test quality issues, and risks.

Be direct, critical, and evidence-based. Your job is to find what is missing, weak, unclear, duplicated, or risky — not to confirm that the existing artifacts are good.

Do not overstate findings that are not supported by the provided input.

## Goal

Review the available QA documentation and provide a clear, actionable coverage review.

The review must help improve:
- QA analysis
- checklist
- test cases
- traceability matrix
- regression scope
- automation readiness
- test execution readiness

## Input

**Mandatory:**
[Paste content from qa/test-cases/[feature-name]-test-cases.md]

[Paste content from qa/checklists/[feature-name]-checklist.md]

**Optional, paste if available:**
[Traceability matrix from qa/traceability/[feature-name]-rtm.md]

[QA analysis from qa/analysis/[feature-name]-analysis.md]

[SRS / functional requirements from docs/srs/ or docs/requirements/]

[Acceptance criteria]

[Design screenshots / design descriptions from docs/designs/]

[API documentation from docs/api/]

[Business rules from docs/business-rules/]

[Known issues / previous QA comments]

[Open questions from qa/questions/]

If mandatory inputs are missing, mark the review as `Blocked coverage review` and list exactly what is needed.

If optional inputs are missing, continue with the available materials, but clearly mark affected areas as `Blocked` if they cannot be assessed reliably.

## Output Location

Save the result to:

`qa/reports/[feature-name]-coverage-review.md`

or, if reports are not used for this feature:

`qa/analysis/[feature-name]-coverage-review.md`

## Review Principles

Follow these principles during the review:

1. Base all findings only on the provided input.
2. Do not invent requirements, business rules, user roles, API behavior, or design elements.
3. If something is missing, clearly mark it as missing.
4. If an area cannot be assessed due to insufficient input, mark it as `Blocked`, not `Partial`.
5. Focus on meaningful and feature-relevant gaps only.
6. Do not list generic theoretical scenarios unless they are relevant to the provided feature.
7. Use provided test case IDs, checklist item IDs, requirement IDs, or section names as evidence whenever available.
8. Do not duplicate the same finding across multiple sections.
9. Use the Coverage Review Table as a summary only.
10. Put detailed findings only in the most relevant detailed section.
11. Use the Prioritized Action List only for consolidated next actions, not repeated full findings.
12. Do not generate a full new checklist unless requested.
13. Do not generate full test cases unless requested.
14. Suggest only missing, weak, unclear, redundant, or risky areas.

## Coverage Status Definitions

Use these definitions consistently:

- `Good`: the area is sufficiently covered by checklist items and test cases, with only minor or no gaps.
- `Partial`: the area has some coverage, but important scenarios, variants, or details are missing.
- `Weak`: the area has minimal, superficial, unclear, or low-value coverage.
- `Blocked`: the provided input does not contain enough information to assess this area.

## Priority Definitions

Use these priority levels:

- `Critical`: must be fixed before test execution or release because it affects core flow, business-critical logic, security, payments, authentication, permissions, or data integrity.
- `High`: should be fixed before test execution because it affects important functionality, common user flows, or high-risk areas.
- `Medium`: should be fixed to improve coverage quality, but does not block execution.
- `Low`: nice-to-have improvement, cleanup, clarification, or low-risk enhancement.

## Review Areas

Review coverage for the following areas:

### 1. Requirement Coverage

Check whether each requirement has at least one checklist item and at least one test case.

A requirement covered only by a checklist item but not by a test case counts as partially covered.

Check for:

- are written in English
- start with `Check that`
- are one sentence only

## Tips
- Use BMAD skill `/bmad-testarch-test-review` for structured review workflow
- Address all Critical and High priority items from the Prioritized Action List before starting execution
- Re-run this review after adding missing tests
