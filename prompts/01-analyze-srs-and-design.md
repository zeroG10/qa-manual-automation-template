# Prompt 01 — Analyze SRS and Design

## Purpose
Analyze source documentation to extract testable requirements, identify gaps, compare SRS with design, and build a shared QA understanding before writing any test artifacts.

## When to Use
- At the start of a new feature or project
- After receiving updated SRS, requirements, or Figma designs
- Before generating checklists or test cases (always run this first)
- Before reviewing test coverage or selecting automation candidates

## Input Required
Place relevant files in `docs/` before running:
- `docs/srs/` — Software Requirements Specification
- `docs/requirements/` — Functional & non-functional requirements
- `docs/designs/` — Figma screenshots or exported design files
- `docs/business-rules/` — Business logic and rules
- `docs/api/` — API documentation, Swagger, Postman collection, or endpoint descriptions
- `docs/notes/` — BA, client, developer, or QA notes (if available)

If a document type is missing, state it explicitly and proceed with available inputs.

## Prompt

```
You are a Senior QA Engineer and Test Analyst. Analyze the provided documentation and produce a structured QA analysis report.

Input documents:
[Paste content or attach files from docs/srs/, docs/requirements/, docs/designs/, docs/business-rules/, docs/api/, docs/notes/]

The analysis will serve as the source for:
- checklist generation
- test case generation
- traceability matrix
- coverage review
- automation candidate selection
- open questions for BA / Dev / Designer

Produce a report with the following sections:

---

## 1. Feature Overview
Describe what the feature does in simple QA-oriented language.
Include:
- What problem it solves and its business value
- What is in scope and what is explicitly out of scope
- How this feature connects to other modules or features in the system
- Affected user roles and platforms (if specified)

If scope is not clear, mark as "Not specified" and add a question to Open Questions.

---

## 2. Source Documents Reviewed
List all documents, designs, API references, screenshots, or notes used for this analysis.

- If behavior is unclear, add it to Open Questions
- If design and SRS conflict, clearly mark the conflict
- If a conclusion is based on assumption, add it to section 16
- Keep confirmed facts, assumptions, risks, and questions clearly separated
- Include source references in all tables where possible
- If source is unclear, mark as "Not traceable"
- Use simple and professional QA language
- Prefer tables for structured information
- Do not generate test cases, checklist items, or automation scripts
- Focus only on analysis
```

## Tips
- Run this before any other prompt in the workflow
- Section 18 (Open Questions) → save to `qa/questions/`
- Section 17 (Risks) + Section 19 Automation Potential → feed into `06-select-automation-candidates.md`
- Section 19 (Suggested Test Areas) → feed into `02-generate-checklist.md`
- Section 3 (Requirements Inventory) → feed into traceability matrix prompt
