# QA Device Coverage Matrix

What we **actually test on**, with priorities. Derived from [docs/platform-specs/supported-devices.md](../../docs/platform-specs/supported-devices.md) but narrower — we test a representative subset, not every supported device.

> Review this matrix every release. Add/remove rows as device fleet changes.

## Priority legend

| Tier | Meaning | When tested |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Must-pass before every release | Full regression + smoke |
| **P1** | Critical paths | Smoke + targeted regression |
| **P2** | Periodic / ad-hoc | Monthly or feature-driven |

| iPhone 15 Pro Max | 17.4 | 6.7" | Large | P1 | Simulator | Dynamic Island, large layouts |
| iPhone 13 | 16.7 | 6.1" | Standard | P1 | Simulator | Latest-1 OS |
| iPad Pro 11" | 17.4 | 11" | Tablet | P2 | Simulator | Only if iPad is supported |

## Android

## Coverage gaps & risks

Document known gaps here. Examples:
- No real-device coverage for low-end Android (RAM ≤ 3GB) — mitigated by emulator with reduced memory
- iOS beta versions not in matrix — covered ad-hoc when Apple releases public beta
