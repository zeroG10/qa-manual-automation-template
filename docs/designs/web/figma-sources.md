# Figma Sources — Web (Admin panel)

Reference for AI agents and QA: which Figma file backs this project's web design,
and how each screen maps to its SRS section. With this file, agents do **not** need a
fresh link each time — just the `fileKey` + the `node-id` of the screen to analyze.

## File

- **Name:** Concert Technologies: Admin panel
- **Platform:** Web (admin panel, desktop browser)
- **fileKey:** `LKywx67GSrdeVA1zxTshao`
- **URL:** https://www.figma.com/design/LKywx67GSrdeVA1zxTshao/Concert-Technologies--Admin-panel
- **Main page (canvas):** `Admin panel` — node `0:1`
- **Other pages:** `Thumbnail` (`1:18049`), `Sandbox` (`47:13424`)

## How agents read it

Read via the project-local Figma MCP server `figma` (PAT-based, see `.mcp.json`):
- Structure / content: `mcp__figma__get_figma_data` with `fileKey` + `nodeId`.
- Images / screenshots: `mcp__figma__download_figma_images`.

To focus on one screen, pass its `node-id` from the table below. A `node-id` is only
needed to scope quickly — agents can also traverse the whole file from `fileKey` alone.

> Update the SRS column as new SRS sections land in `docs/srs/`.
> Re-run `get_figma_data` on `0:1` (depth 1) to refresh node-ids if the design is restructured.
