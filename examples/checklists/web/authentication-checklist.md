## Open Questions

1. Activation token expiration time on the Set Password page is described as "configurable" (NFR-AUTH-SP-02) without a specific value, and `00-common-rules_and_info.md` does not pin it down — testers cannot verify the exact expiration boundary.
2. Password reset token expiration time on the Forgot Password page is described as "configurable" (NFR-AUTH-FP-01) without a specific value — testers cannot verify the exact expiration boundary.
3. Login rate limiting after repeated failed attempts is marked "may be rate-limited (recommended)" (FR-AUTH-LG-11) — it is unclear whether rate limiting is in scope, what the threshold is, and what user-visible behavior should occur on lockout.
4. Forgot Password rate limiting is required (NFR-AUTH-FP-02) but no threshold, time window, or user-visible behavior is specified — testers cannot define expected behavior on the boundary.
5. Remember Me session duration vs default session duration is described as "configured expiration rules" (FR-AUTH-LG-08) without concrete values — testers cannot verify persistence boundaries.
6. The Set Password redirect target is ambiguous: FR-AUTH-SP-08 says "Redirect the user to the Login page (or auto-login, if configured)" — it is unclear which behavior is enabled in this build.
7. The Admin Panel landing page after login is described as "Dashboard or default page" (FR-AUTH-LG-05) — the actual landing route per role is not specified, blocking redirect verification.
8. Password complexity instructional text on the Set Password page is given as an example ("e.g., …longer than 12 characters…") — it is unclear whether "longer than 12" means strictly greater than 12 or at least 12 (FR-AUTH-SP-04 says "≥ 12"), creating a boundary-test conflict.
9. Maximum password length, allowed character set, and whether spaces or Unicode are permitted in the New Password field are not specified — testers cannot define upper-bound and edge-case behavior.
10. Email field constraints on the Login and Forgot Password pages (max length, allowed local-part/domain rules, case sensitivity, trimming) are not specified.
11. Behavior when the same activation link is opened in two browser tabs simultaneously is not specified.
12. Server-side vs client-side error placement on the Login page: the SRS left this as "inline or as a banner" (Error Feedback); the design resolves it as a top banner ("Incorrect email or password.") for server-side errors and inline text for client-side field errors — confirm this is the final intended behavior.
13. Mobile responsiveness scope is unclear: SRS section 2.5 says responsive design with min width 1366px and explicitly states mobile is not required (2.3), so the Mobile Responsiveness section is omitted from this checklist — confirm this is intentional for the Authentication pages.
14. Account enumeration protection on the Login page is not addressed — it is unclear whether "Account disabled or not activated" errors (Server-Side Errors) should reveal account state or be folded into a generic error like the Forgot Password flow.
15. Logout endpoint behavior and the redirect target on session expiration are not defined within the Authentication SRS section.
16. Design↔SRS conflict on the Login "Client-side error" state: the design shows the "Log in" button enabled while the Email field holds an invalid format, but FR-AUTH-LG-04 and check CHK-AUTH-072 require it to stay disabled until the email format is valid — confirm which behavior is correct (source: Figma node 31:19850).
17. The Login design shows the "Remember me" checkbox pre-selected by default; the SRS does not specify a default state, and defaulting session persistence to on has security implications — confirm whether pre-checked is intended (source: Figma node 31:19825).
