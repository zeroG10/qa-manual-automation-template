3. Remember-me / persistent session behavior is not defined — the SRS does not specify session token lifetime, refresh strategy, or whether a returning user must re-verify OTP.
4. The exact resend countdown duration on the Phone number verification screen is not specified, blocking timer boundary testing.
5. The exact OTP expiration window (time after which a delivered code becomes invalid) is not specified.
6. The maximum OTP retry attempts before the 2-minute block on the Phone number verification screen is not specified.
7. The allowed country-code set for the "+1" selector on the Registration and Login screens is not specified — the example uses US "+1" but the supported set is unclear.

9. International phone number validation rules (allowed country codes, default region, formatting) are not specified — the example uses US "+1" but the supported set is unclear.
10. Maximum phone number length and allowed characters (spaces, dashes, parentheses formatting) on Registration and Login screens are not specified.
11. Behavior when the user receives a phone call or another full-screen interruption while on the Phone number verification screen (timer behavior, OTP input preservation) is not specified.
12. Behavior of the system back navigation on the Phone number verification screen when reached from Registration vs Login is not differentiated in the SRS.
13. Whether the Registration optional Email field is used for anything downstream (notifications, account recovery) is not specified, blocking validation of its purpose.
14. Dark mode parity for the Registration, Login, Phone number verification, and Email address verification screens is not specified.
15. RTL layout support (Arabic, Hebrew) is not specified for any auth screen.
